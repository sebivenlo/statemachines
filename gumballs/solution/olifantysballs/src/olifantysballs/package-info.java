/**
 * Idea from Head First Design Patterns (ISBN 9780596007126), implementing a
 * state machine using the state pattern, modified to use enum as state
 * implementation and made testable.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>This version uses Java 8 features which makes it possible to do a lot of work in the {@link State}
 * interface, using {@code default} and {@code static} methods and avoids code
 * duplication, while still being able to use a java enum as the concrete state
 * implementations.
 * <li>
 * There is one disadvantage with this approach: the methods will be in the
 * interface and in Java that means public, which is alleviated a bit by keeping
 * the state and possibly the implementing class package private, so that no one
 * outside the package can fiddle with these parts.
 *</ul>
