class StateStack:
Stack of states which can be used to lookup states.
Implementation is already abstract, can be improved by using a linked list ( not having the Arrays.copyOf() ).

class StateEnum implements CCState:
State enum defines states and which transitions can be used in these states. (also the entry/exit state are here defined).
